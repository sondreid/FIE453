## A note on PCA

We have tested running various SVM models on a subset of the numeric variables, as well as using all variables, and reducing the dimensions of the variables by Principal Component Analysis. 

The goal of the Principal Component Analysis is to reduce the variables into a fewer dimensions. 



## Accuracy measure:
    Accuracy



## On the performance of the models


### Model 1
Our first model is tested using PCA reduced dimensions of all variables. PCA allows us to use find the most variance in the dimensions used in our model.
Allows for compactness of an otherwise infeasible model search space. 


Preciscion:
    Relatively low preciscion.
    Indicating that too many
