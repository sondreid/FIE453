## A note on PCA

We have tested running various SVM models on a subset of the numeric variables, as well as using all variables, and reducing the dimensions of the variables by Principal Component Analysis. 

The goal of the Principal Component Analysis is to reduce the variables into a fewer dimensions. 



## Accuracy measure:

## On the performance of the models
